Heart Circle Animation
This is a simple JavaScript code snippet that generates a heart circle animation effect. The animation creates heart-shaped circles at the position where the mouse moves on the screen. All the logic is contained within the index.js file, making it easy to integrate into your project.

Usage
Include index.js in your HTML file.
Ensure you have a canvas element in your HTML file where the animation will be rendered.
How it Works
When the mouse moves, a heart-shaped circle is created at the mouse position.
The animation continuously updates to move the hearts downwards on the screen while rotating them slightly.
Dependencies
No external libraries or frameworks are required. The animation relies solely on vanilla JavaScript and HTML5 canvas.
